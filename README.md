Application of entry-level Python syntax as a Computer Science first class assignment. Inputs, variable declaration, and simple algebra.

User input of a radius was then followed by calculation and printing of the area of a circle. Then, the input of an object mass was asked. The proceeding calculation focused on using algebra and Albert Einstein's mass-energy equivalence on the object mass. In the last section of the project, two user-inputted masses alongside the user-inputted distance between them were calculated using the law of universal gravitation equation.
